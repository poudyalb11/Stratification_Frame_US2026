# SCRIPT 13: Construct vote_2024 column for CES respondents
#
# Purpose:
#   Create a single, clean party-level vote variable for each CES respondent,
#   drawn from the most reliable source available in the CES survey instrument.
#   This is the modeling target for the multinomial vote-choice regression.
#
# Background — the CES 2024 vote-related variables:
#
#   The CES has both pre-election and post-election waves. Vote-related
#   information is captured in multiple questions across these waves, with
#   different gating logic per question.
#
#   Pre-election (asked of all pre-wave respondents, with branching):
#
#     CC24_363 — Vote intention
#       "Do you intend to vote in the 2024 general election on November 5th?"
#       Codes: 1 = Yes, definitely
#              2 = Probably
#              3 = I already voted (early or absentee)
#              4 = I plan to vote before November 5th
#              5 = No
#              6 = Undecided
#              8/9 = Skipped / Not asked
#       Asked of all respondents.
#
#     CC24_367 — House preference
#       "In the general election for U.S. House of Representatives in your
#        area, who do you prefer?"
#       Codes: 1-5 = $HouseCand1Name through $HouseCand5Name (candidate index)
#              10  = Other
#              98  = I'm not sure
#              99  = No one
#              998/999 = Skipped / Not asked
#       Asked of respondents who hadn't already voted at pre-wave time
#       (complement of CC24_367_voted).
#
#     CC24_367_voted — House vote (early voters only)
#       "For which House candidate did you vote?"
#       Codes: 1-5 = candidate index (same mapping as CC24_367)
#              10  = Other
#              98  = Not sure
#              99  = Didn't vote
#              998/999 = Skipped / Not asked
#       ONLY asked of respondents who said CC24_363 == 3 (already voted
#       before the pre-election survey).
#
#   Post-election (only for tookpost == 2 respondents):
#
#     CC24_401 — Turnout
#       "Voted in the 2024 election? Which of the following statements best
#        describes you?"
#       Codes: 1 = I did not vote in the election this November
#              2 = I thought about voting this time – but didn't
#              3 = I usually vote, but didn't this time
#              4 = I attempted to vote but did not or could not
#              5 = I definitely voted in the November 2024 General Election
#              8/9 = Skipped / Not asked
#       Asked of all post-wave respondents.
#
#     CC24_412 — House vote (post-wave)
#       "Who did you vote in the election (House)?"
#       Codes: 1-5 = candidate index (same mapping)
#              10  = Other
#              11  = I did not vote in this race
#              12  = I did not vote
#              13  = Not sure
#              98/99 = Skipped / Not asked
#       Only shown if at least one House candidate exists for that
#       respondent's district.
#
#   Candidate party lookup:
#     HouseCand1Party, ..., HouseCand5Party hold the party affiliation of
#     each candidate. The candidate index in any of the vote questions
#     above maps directly to these columns.
#
# Waterfall logic (in order of preference):
#   (a) CC24_412   — Confirmed votes from post-wave (most reliable)
#   (b) CC24_401   — Post-wave confirmation of non-voting
#   (c) CC24_367_voted — Pre-wave reported actual votes (early voters)
#   (d) CC24_367   — Pre-wave reported vote preference
#   (e) CC24_363   — Pre-wave reported intention not to vote (No Vote only)
#   (f) NA         — No clean information available
