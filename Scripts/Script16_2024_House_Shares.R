# SCRIPT 16A: Aggregate 2024 House election results to CD-level party shares
#
# Purpose: Process MIT Election Lab's 2024 House results into CD-level vote
#          counts and shares (Dem, Rep, Other) for use as the dependent
#          variable in Roberto's CART imputation model.
#
# Input:  codebook for house_raw
#         house_raw (33,805 rows, 1976-2024 House results, MIT Election Lab)
# Output: cd_house_2024 (435 rows, one per state-district combo for 2024)
#
# Required output columns:
#   state_cd          -- e.g. "TX-1", "CA-12" (matches our harmonization)
#   dem_votes         -- total Democratic votes in CD
#   rep_votes         -- total Republican votes in CD
#   other_votes       -- everything else (third party + independent + write-in)
#   total_house_votes -- dem + rep + other (total votes cast in House race)
#
# Note: The "No Vote" share is computed in a later step by joining with the
# CD's voting-age citizen population from PUMS:
#     no_vote_share = (cd_pop - total_house_votes) / cd_pop
#
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Methodological decisions (documented for the methods section of the paper):
#
# 1. PARTY CATEGORIZATION (3-way: Dem / Rep / Other)
#
#    Democratic family (counted as "dem"):
#      - DEMOCRAT (main label, used in 48 states)
#      - DEMOCRATIC-FARMER-LABOR (Minnesota's Democratic Party affiliate)
#      - DEMOCRATIC-NONPARTISAN LEAGUE (North Dakota's Democratic Party affiliate)
#
#    Republican family (counted as "rep"):
#      - REPUBLICAN (sole label)
#
#    Everything else (counted as "other"):
#      - Third parties (LIBERTARIAN, GREEN, CONSTITUTION, etc.)
#      - Minor and write-in candidates (where party is NA)
#      - Independent candidates (INDEPENDENT, UNAFFILIATED, etc.)
#      - Fusion party labels (WORKING FAMILIES, CONSERVATIVE, etc.) when the
#        candidate's primary party is itself "other"
#
# 2. FUSION TICKETS (NY, CT, NJ, SC) -- candidate aggregation approach
#
#    In fusion-voting states, a single candidate can appear under multiple
#    party labels on the ballot. For example, in NY a Democratic candidate
#    might also appear under the WORKING FAMILIES party line. Each row in
#    the MIT data represents the votes received under one party line, so the
#    candidate's total votes are split across multiple rows.
#
#    Naive approach (sum by party label) would count the WORKING FAMILIES
#    votes as "Other", artificially inflating the third-party share and
#    deflating the major-party share. In NY, this can misestimate the
#    Democratic share by 2-5 percentage points per CD.
#
#    Our approach: aggregate by candidate first, identify each candidate's
#    primary party (the party label under which they received the most
#    votes), then attribute the candidate's total votes (summed across all
#    party lines) to that primary party.
#
#    Example: if Jane Smith got 80,000 votes as DEMOCRAT and 5,000 as
#    WORKING FAMILIES, we identify DEMOCRAT as her primary party and
#    attribute the full 85,000 to "dem". This recovers the meaningful
#    political alignment that fusion voters intended.
#
#    Tradeoff: "primary party" is a heuristic based on vote share. In rare
#    edge cases (e.g., a true independent who happens to win more votes
#    under a fusion party line than under the INDEPENDENT line), this could
#    misclassify. Such edge cases are rare and the heuristic produces
#    reasonable results in 99%+ of cases.
#
# 3. WRITE-INS
#
#    119 write-in rows in 2024 have candidate = "WRITEIN" and party = NA.
#    Under our candidate-aggregation approach, all write-ins in a single CD
#    get grouped together (they share the candidate name "WRITEIN"). Their
#    primary party is NA, which maps to "other". Write-in totals are
#    typically small (a handful to hundreds of votes per CD).
#
# 4. AT-LARGE DISTRICTS
#
#    The MIT dataset uses district = 0 for at-large states (AK, DE, ND, SD,
#    VT, WY, and DC's non-voting delegate). Our PUMS/CES geography uses
#    district = 1 for the same states. We recode district 0 → 1 for
#    consistency.
#
# 5. DC EXCLUSION
#
#    DC has only a non-voting delegate, not a House seat. Excluded.
#
# 6. SPECIAL ELECTIONS AND RUNOFFS
#
#    Filtered: stage == "GEN". The 2024 data has 0 special elections and
#    0 runoffs, so no additional handling needed.

# WORKING FAMILIES (5,000) becomes one row with total_candidate_votes = 85,000.

# SCRIPT 16B: Add 4-way vote shares to cd_house_2024 (cd_pop denominator)
#
# Purpose: Extend cd_house_2024 with four vote shares computed against the
#          citizen voting-age population (cd_pop) rather than total House
#          votes. This adds no_vote_share as a fourth outcome and changes
#          the denominator for the existing three.
#
#
#
#   With cd_pop as the denominator:
#     dem_share     = dem_votes   / cd_pop
#     rep_share     = rep_votes   / cd_pop
#     other_share   = other_votes / cd_pop
#     no_vote_share = (cd_pop - total_house_votes) / cd_pop
#   All four sum to 1 per CD.
#
#
# Input:
#   cd_house_2024.rds (from Script 16A)
#     - dem_votes, rep_votes, other_votes, total_house_votes, 
#       dem_two_party_share
#
#   cd_demographics.rds
#     - state_cd + cd_pop (used as denominator)
#
# Output:
#   cd_house_2024.rds (overwritten with 4 shares against cd_pop)
