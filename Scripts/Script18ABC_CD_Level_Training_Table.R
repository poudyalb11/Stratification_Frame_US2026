# SCRIPTS 18A / 18B / 18C: Build the CD-level training table for CART
#
# Purpose:
#   Assemble a single CD-level training table with predictors, outcomes,
#   and modeling flags, ready for the CART inheritance model in Script 20+.
#
#   Each row is one of the 435 CDs. Columns include demographic proportions,
#   state-level presidential features, 2024 House vote shares, and flags
#   distinguishing which CDs feed into training vs. prediction.
#
# Pipeline overview:
#
#   Script 18A — Build inheritance table (cd_2026_inheritance.rds)
#     For each 2026 CD in the 7 redistricted states, identify the dominant
#     2024 CD it maps to and compute population overlap. CDs with >=95%
#     overlap are flagged as "essentially unchanged" — they can inherit
#     their 2024 House result as-is.
#
#     Inputs:  all_bafs, cd119_redistricted, all_blocks_pop (in-memory or from disk)
#     Output:  cd_2026_inheritance.rds
#
#   Script 18B — Assemble base training table (training_table.rds v1)
#     Join cd_demographics, cd_house_2024, and state_pres_2024 into one
#     table per CD. Sets a coarse state-level is_redistricted flag.
#
#     Inputs:  cd_demographics.rds, cd_house_2024.rds, state_pres_2024.rds
#     Output:  training_table.rds (base)
#
#   Script 18C — Refine flags and add contestation (training_table.rds v2)
#     Uses the inheritance table from 18A to move essentially-unchanged CDs
#     from prediction_set back into training_set. Builds a contestation
#     column and sets a 2-value training_eligibility flag.
#
#     Inputs:  training_table.rds, cd_house_2024.rds, cd_2026_inheritance.rds
#     Output:  training_table.rds (final)
#
# Final training_table (from 18C) has:
#   - 435 rows (one per CD)
#   - ~29 demographic feature columns (pct_age_*, pct_male, etc.)
#   - 4 state-level presidential feature columns (state_pres_*_share)
#   - 4 outcome columns (dem_share, rep_share, other_share, no_vote_share)
#   - Modeling flags: is_redistricted, contestation, training_eligibility
#
# End-to-end row counts:
#   - training_set:   ~318 CDs (all stable-state CDs + 42 essentially-unchanged)
#   - prediction_set: ~117 CDs (genuinely new geography in redistricted states)
#
# Why these three scripts share a file:
#   18B and 18C both write to training_table.rds and depend on the same
#   inputs. Keeping them together lets us run 18A → 18B → 18C sequentially
#   in one R session without repeated disk I/O. 18A is included because
#   it produces the inheritance table that 18C needs.

# SCRIPT 18A: Identify essentially-unchanged 2026 CDs in redistricted states
#
# Purpose: Within each of the 7 redistricted states, identify 2026 CDs that
#          are essentially unchanged from a single 2024 (119th Congress) CD.
#          For these CDs, we can use the 2024 House results from the old CD
#          as the area-level covariate for the new CD — no CART imputation
#          needed.
#
# Why: The 7 redistricted states had legal/political changes to their CD
#      maps for 2026, but not every district was substantially redrawn. Many
#      were renumbered slightly, shifted at the margins, or left effectively
#      unchanged. Treating all 159 CDs in the 7 states as "redistricted"
#      throws away genuine information about those whose populations are
#      effectively the same as in 2024.
#
# Inputs:
#   - all_bafs           : block → cd_2026 (from state BAFs)
#   - cd119_redistricted : block → cd_119 (from Script 12)
#   - all_blocks_pop     : block → 2020 population (from tidycensus)
#
# Output:
#   - cd_2026_inheritance.rds — one row per 2026 CD in the 7 states, with:
#       state_fips, cd_2026, dominant_cd_119, overlap_pct,
#       essentially_unchanged, cd_2026_total_pop
#
# Methodology:
#   1. For each block in the 7 redistricted states: we know cd_2026 (from BAFs),
#      cd_119 (from the 119th CD BEF built in Script 12), and population
#      (from tidycensus, loaded in Script 08).
#   2. For each (state, cd_2026), compute population from each source cd_119.
#   3. Compute overlap_pct = pop from dominant cd_119 / total cd_2026 pop.
#      This is the "new-CD-side" perspective: "of the people now in this
#      new CD, what fraction came from one specific old CD?"
#   4. Flag as essentially_unchanged if overlap_pct >= 0.95.
#
# Sections:
#   1. Build block-level table (state, cd_2026, cd_119, pop)
#   2. Aggregate to (state, cd_2026, cd_119) population intersections
#   3. For each cd_2026, find dominant cd_119 and compute overlap_pct
#   4. Examine overlap_pct distribution
#   5. Symmetry validation (forward vs reverse overlap)
#   6. Save

# Purpose: Combine cd_demographics, cd_house_2024, and state_pres_2024 into

#          all 435 CDs, all features and outcomes joined, and a preliminary
#          is_redistricted flag set on state basis alone.
#
# The base table doesn't yet handle inheritance (whether a redistricted CD
# is essentially unchanged from a 2024 CD) or contestation flagging. Those
# are added in Script 18C.
#
# Inputs:

# SCRIPT 18C: Refine is_redistricted, add contestation, and set
#             training_eligibility
#
# Purpose: Take the base training_table from Script 18B and add three flags:
#
#   1. Refine is_redistricted using inheritance overlap:
#      - Essentially-unchanged CDs (>=95% overlap with a single 2024 CD)
#        get is_redistricted = FALSE (they inherit the 2024 result)
#      - Genuinely new CDs keep is_redistricted = TRUE
#
#   2. Build contestation column:
#      - For known 2026-uncontested CDs (CA-14, CA-29, CA-40, FL-10): FALSE
#      - For genuinely redistricted CDs: TRUE (assume 2026 races contested;
#        don't inherit from old district since it's been substantially redrawn)
#      - For stable / essentially-unchanged CDs: inherit from 2024 contestation
#        (>10 vote threshold per major party)
#
#   3. Set training_eligibility (2-value):
#      - !is_redistricted → "training_set" (~318 CDs)
#      - is_redistricted  → "prediction_set" (~117 CDs)
#
# Note on contestation vs training_eligibility:
#   Contestation is a FEATURE in the CART model (a predictor), not a filter.
#   Uncontested CDs still enter the training set — they're just marked as
#   uncontested so the model can learn to predict their inflated no_vote_share.
#
# Inputs:
#   training_table.rds       (base version from Script 18B, has 
#                             coarse is_redistricted based on state)
#   cd_house_2024.rds        (used to compute 2024 contestation)
